// Tasks
// 1. Create a text that says "Current count: 0"
// 1. Create a primary_button with the text "Count up to 10"
// 2. Create a secondary_button that says "Reset counter"
// 2. Once the primary_button is clicked, we should show a loading spinner inside that primary_button
// 3. Every second, the count should increase by 1, the text should update to reflect the current count ("Current count: 1", "Current count: 2", etc.)
// 4. Once the count reaches 10, the loading spinner should disappear and the primary_button should be disabled
// 5. If the secondary_button is clicked, the count should go back to 0 and the primary_button should be enabled again
